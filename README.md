# Quill
Quill ia a basic flat compiler that takes a C like syntax and produces HTML.

# Why
Quill was made so I wouldn't have to write HTML for homework in High School. Since it was made in a few days. It does not always use good code. At some point I might go back and fix it, but I make no promises.

# Building
Quill includes a Premake file.
